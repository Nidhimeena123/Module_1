SDLC and Phases of SDLC

A Software Development Life Cycle is essentially a series of steps, or phases, that provide a model for the development and lifecycle management of an application of software.

1.Requirement Gathering:
Features
Usage scenarios
User and business needs change during the project
Validation is needed throughout the software lifecycle, not only when the final system is delivered.

2.Analysis Phase
The analysis phase defines the requirements of the system, independent of how these Requirements will be accomplished.
 This phase defines the problem that the customer is trying to solve.
 The deliverable result at the end of this phase is a requirement document.

3.Design Phase
Design Architecture Document
Implementation Plan
Critical Priority Analysis
Performance Analysis
Test Plan

4.Implementation Phase
In the implementation phase, the team builds the components either from scratch or by composition.

5.Testing Phase
Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

6.Maintenance Phase
Software maintenance is one of the activities in software engineering, and is the process
of enhancing and optimizing deployed software (software release), as well as fixing
defects.
